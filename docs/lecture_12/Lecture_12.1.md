This lecture introduces the future challenges faced by decision-makers
when planning long-term infrastructure projects. It describes four
drivers that can influence risk in the future: (1) climate change, (2)
environmental change, (3) socio-economic change and (4) changes in
societal dependencies on infrastructure.

# Learning objectives

-   Understand how risk has changed over time
-   Identify the different drivers of changing risk
-   Learn what dependencies and feedbacks exist between infrastructure
    and society.

# Introduction



# Summary

In this lecture, we have given a brief introduction to how risk changes
over time and identified the four main drivers of future hazard risk.
