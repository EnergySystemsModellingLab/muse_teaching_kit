# Learning objectives

-   Describe Saint Lucia's national priorities, greenhouse gas
    emissions, implementation capacity, mitigation co-benefits, and
    Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets
-   Synthesise the material covered in Lecture block 2 mini-lectures
-   Apply the approach to developing infrastructure targets within NDCs
    to a desired country context.

# Step 1: Assess national infrastructure development priorities and identify key infrastructure systems


# Summary

This mini-lecture walked through the basic information required to
develop NDCs using Saint Lucia as a case study. The mini-lecture sought
to synthesise the material covered in Lecture block 2 on infrastructure
systems' greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation targets, and sustainable
development impact.
