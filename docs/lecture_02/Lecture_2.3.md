Mini-lecture 2.3 provides an overview of infrastructure and mitigation
action's potential co-benefits using the United Nation's Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) framework. Through the methodologies presented,
the lecture highlights key infrastructure sectors for mitigation action
and far-reaching cross-sectoral sustainable development.

# Learning objectives

-   Indicate infrastructure's influence on sustainable development using
    the SDG framework
-   Indicate mitigation action's influence on sustainable development
    using the SDG framework
-   Utilise the SDG framework to pinpoint key infrastructure sectors for
    mitigation action based on mutual SDG influence.

# Introduction


# Summary  {#summary-1}

This mini-lecture provided insight into evaluating the sustainable
development impact of mitigation actions within networked infrastructure
systems. The lecture highlighted which systems would lead to the most
mitigation co-benefits using the SDG framework. Going more in-depth
into, and applying the methodologies described to a particular context,
will bring critical development pathways to life. The next mini-lecture
addresses how this can practically be achieved via a case study in St.
Lucia.
