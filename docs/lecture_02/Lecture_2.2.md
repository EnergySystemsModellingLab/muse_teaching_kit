# Learning objectives

- Identify the key components which make up MUSE


# Introduction


# Summary

This mini-lecture provided key information to understand the
requirements of NDCs and thus develop mitigation targets within them.
The approach proposed to develop mitigation targets in the
infrastructure sector considers the Paris Agreement's stipulations and
the NDC's varying responsibilities, all which inform the types of
targets that countries may pursue. Steps 1 to 4 of the approach involve
collecting information which countries should already possess. Steps 5
and 6 critically assess co-benefits across these areas and determine
targeted action. Steps 7 and 8 devise and output mitigation targets. The
next mini-lecture presents further insight into Steps 5 and 6 by
detailing a methodology to evaluate cross sectoral co-benefits.
