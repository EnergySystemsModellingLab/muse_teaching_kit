# Short description

This mini-lecture will provide an overview of how the course is structured.

# Learning objectives

- To present the structure of the course for both the lecture content
    and the hands-on sessions
- To obtain an introductory insight into the content delivered within
    this course.

# Introduction and structure of the course

This course is made up of 9 lectures and 9 hands-on exercises. Whilst the lectures will give you a background to energy modelling, you will also learn how to practically build a case study using the MUSE model.

To build up a good understanding of MUSE, you will be required to understand why we use energy systems modelling and the main features that make up a good energy systems model. You will learn of the trade-offs between different decisions, such as increasing data granularity versus overall model run time.

The overall lecture structure is presented below:

1. Energy systems modelling
2. Introduction to MUSE
3. Sectors
4. Technologies
5. Agents
6. Regions
7. Timeslices
8. Energy demands
9. Communicating research

First, you will have an overview of energy systems modelling. Then we will introduce you to the agent-based model, MUSE. The next lectures detail the key components that make up MUSE. Some of these, such as energy demands and timeslices are common to all energy systems models, and some are unique to MUSE's agent-based modelling type, such as regions.

The accompanying hands-on exercises are:

1. Installing MUSE
2. Running MUSE
3. Adding a new technology
4. Adding an agent
5. Adding a region
6. Modifying timeslicing
7. Production constraints by timeslice
8. Adding a service demand
9. Adding a service demand by correlation

Through these hands-on exercises, you will pick up the key skills needed to design your own energy systems models with MUSE.
