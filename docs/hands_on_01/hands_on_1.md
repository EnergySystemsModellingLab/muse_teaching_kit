## Installation process


Windows users and developers may need to install `Windows Build Tools`__. These tools include C/C++ compilers which are needed to build some python dependencies.

MacOS includes compilers by default, hence no action is needed for Mac users.

Linux users may need to install a C compiler, whether GNU gcc or Clang, as well python development packages, depending on their distribution.

1. Install Visual Studio from the following link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

2. Select your preferred edition. Although, the "Community" version is free and contains what is required.

3. Install Visual Studio by selecting the default options.

4.   Download the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools from the following link by downloading Visual Studio 2019: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/   

5. Select your preferred edition. The "Community" is free and contains what is required.

6.   Run the installer

7.   Select: Workloads → Desktop development with C++.

8. Install options: select only the “Windows 10 SDK” (assuming the computer is Windows 10)]. This will come up on the right hand side of the screen.

The installation screen should look similar to the following:
