# Learning objectives

# Key features of presentations

The key features of presentations are:

- Entry point: capture the audience's attention
- Aim: focus on what you want to achieve with the presentation
- Structure: ensure consistency across the slides and tell a coherent story from beginning to end
- Audience: plan for your audience and their background
- Impact: identify key take-home points that the audience should remember

Firstly, there is the entry point of the presentation. It is important to focus the audience's attention. This ensures that they are interested in the presentation and understand what will be presented. 

Throughout the presentation it is important to have the aim in mind. For example, you could be trying to increase engagement with a new department. 

The structure of the presentation can be tailored to your aim. It is important to have a clear beginning middle and end. There should be consistency across the presentation to maximise the audience's understanding. 

To further ensure that the audience undestand and engage with the presentation, it should be designed with the audience's backgrounds and motivations in mind.

Finally, it is important to consider the imnpact of the presentation and identify key points that you would like the audience to remember.

## Audiences

It is important to understand the types of audience that you will be presenting to. For instance, they may be generalists or non-specialists. Or they could be scientists from different disciplines, or even scientists from the same discipline, but focusing on different topics.

The presentation should be adsapted depending on your audience in order to increase the audience's understanding and engagement. Technical content, for example, can be explained in a simple and understandable manner if the audience contains non-specialists. If you think that your audience, on the other hand, will have technical expertise, you can spend less time on explaining technical content. 

The purpose of the presentation should be optimised throughout. For example, if you are aiming to create a partnership with a new department, the presentation should have a focus on the implications of your research for that department and the benefits of the proposed partnership for the audience.


# Summary

In this mini-lecture we introduced some key tips for oral presentations. We explored why understanding your audience of importance, especially when introducing technical content. We also learnt that we can be strategic in our presentation planning and should optimise for the aims for which we want to achieve.
