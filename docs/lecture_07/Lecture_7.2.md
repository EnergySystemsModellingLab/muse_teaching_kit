In this mini-lecture we will introduce some methods to translate socioeconomic data into MUSE with a quantitative approach.

# Learning objectives

- Discuss surveys and socioeconomic data and how these can relate to MUSE
- Discover ways that surveys can be used in quantitative modelling

# Qualitative representation in agent-based models

Through the use of qualitative data, such as using qualitative surveys, it is possible to gain greater insight into the different characteristics of consumers or investors. One example of how this can be done was by Moya et al. (2020). In this paper the authors explore fuel-switching investment in the long-term energy transitions of India's industry sector. They inform the modelled agents through a questionnaire that was carried out to inform MUSE.

Some of the types of questions asked in the questionnaire to industrial companies are listed below:

- Geographical location
- Financial details
- Investment plans
- Type of fuels used
- Willingness to switch fuels

Once these data have been collected, they can be used to find similar groups of investors and to start characterising the agents. For instance, if from the data it is clear that geographical location is an important consideration, the decision could be made to group companies by geographical region and form an agent on this basis. If the more important consideration is the investment plans, then a group can be made there. 

This approach is a more than efficient method of better understanding the characteristics of agents of a system, and it can help to inform a better modelling process. The work by Moya et al. ([@Moya2020]) finds that the results represent the unique heterogeneity of fuel-switching industrial investors with distinct investment goals and limited foresight on costs. In other words, the survey results have an impact on the outcome of the energy system over the long-term.


# Summary

In this mini-lecture we explored how surveys can be used to inform agents within MUSE. We also discovered how these results can affect the modelling outcomes of energy systems.
