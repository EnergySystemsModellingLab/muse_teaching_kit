## Short description

Following mini-lecture 3.2, this mini-lecture provides an insight into
estimating infrastructure carbon emissions. Ideally, carbon emissions
data can be sourced from relevant country stakeholders. However, in many
cases the data is not available or insufficient and infrastructure
emissions need to be estimated. This mini-lecture outlines a methodology
for calculating these emissions.

## Learning objectives

-   Estimate gross carbon emissions of infrastructure systems.

# Lecture content



## Summary

Mini-lecture 3.3 illustrated a simple method for estimating the carbon
emissions of infrastructure systems in lieu of detailed in-country data.
The mini-lecture further pointed towards a good source of carbon
emission capacity factors: @Schlomer2014.
