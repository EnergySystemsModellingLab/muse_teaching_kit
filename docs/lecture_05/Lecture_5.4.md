This mini-lecture will demonstrate how development targets have been
incorporated in the infrastructure strategy of Saint Lucia using inputs
from an infrastructure planning tool. It will present results showing
specific targets being met within a broader infrastructure strategy.

# Learning objectives
-   To learn methods for constructing and incorporating development
    targets in infrastructure assessment
-   To demonstrate the construction and use of a 'Sustainable
    Development Goal (SDG) indicator' as a measure of target progress,
    using knowledge developed in the previous lectures.

# Development targets and objectives in national infrastructure planning



# Summary

This mini-lecture has demonstrated the incorporation of targets in
infrastructure planning. It has used a small island case study to show
how relevant targets can be identified through stakeholder and document
consultation, global agendas, target extrapolation, and international
best practice. Infrastructure strategies and results should be
explicitly shaped by these targets, which can be altered as new data or
priorities emerge.
