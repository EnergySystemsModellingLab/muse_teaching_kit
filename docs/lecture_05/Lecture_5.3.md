In this mini-lecture we will learn about the input and output commodities within MUSE. Specifically we will learn what the `CommIn.csv` and `CommOut.csv` files do.

# Learning objectives

-   To learn the importance of input and output commodities
-   To learn how we can modify these commodities in MUSE

# Introducing commodities

Input commodities are the commodities consumed by each technology. This could be coal for a coal power plant, uranium for a nuclear power plant or electricity for an electric heater. This is dependent on the technology, and some technologies can have multiple inputs.

Output commodities are similar, but are the outputs of technologies. For example the output of any power plant will be electricity, or heat for heaters. Again, this is dependent on the technology, and some technologies can have multiple outputs such as combined heat and power plants.

The ratio between these two parameters are very important in MUSE and in energy modelling in general. This is because it defines the efficiency of the technology. For instance, if a coal power plant requires 1 PJ of energy stored in coal to output 0.8 PJ of electricity, the coal power plant has an efficiency of 0.8. The higher the efficiency the more economical the power plant is and the more competitive it will be when compared to different technologies.

# Summary

This lecture has introduced the importance of methods that draw on the
'climate-compatible development' framework. It has assessed ways in
which researchers look to consolidate climate and development targets in
national policy documents. Within the NDCs, current ambition as regards
mitigation action in infrastructure and land use policy has been
described, with a call for a framework that better integrates these two
areas to bring about concrete policy actions.
