This lecture looks beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at
how infrastructure planning can be further shaped by climate change
targets through the Paris Agreement. While this draws on much of the
material from Lecture block 2, it presents emerging research on the
alignment of these two agendas in the run-up to the next Conference of
the Parties (COP) as countries aim to set a vision for climate and
development.

# Learning objectives

-   To describe the policy relevance of the concept of
    'climate-compatible development'

-   To relate methods by which researchers have attempted to understand
    interactions between climate and development targets in policy
    documents.

# Introduction



# Summary

This lecture has introduced the importance of methods that draw on the
'climate-compatible development' framework. It has assessed ways in
which researchers look to consolidate climate and development targets in
national policy documents. Within the NDCs, current ambition as regards
mitigation action in infrastructure and land use policy has been
described, with a call for a framework that better integrates these two
areas to bring about concrete policy actions.
