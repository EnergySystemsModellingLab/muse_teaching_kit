This lecture will introduce the various technologies and how we can represent them within MUSE. We will also learn about the supply chains in which these technologies exist in. Finally, we will learn about the key characteristics of the different technologies in the context of MUSE. 

# Learning objectives

- Understand the concepts of technologies and supply chains

- Learn how to represent technologies in MUSE

- Understand the key characteristics of technologies

# Introduction



# Summary

This lecture has introduced the role of performance indicators in
framing infrastructure assessment. It has provided an example of a
common indicator framework and how it has been applied to infrastructure
decision-making. Key criteria used for indicator selection are proposed,
including policy relevance, analytical soundness, and measurability.
Main drawbacks of traditional approaches are suggested, including
simplified aggregation, lack of alignment with a national infrastructure
vision, and a need to reflect the range of attributes desired by users.
While there has been a shift toward incorporating sustainability
dimensions in infrastructure assessment, many studies have focused on a
single sector or outcome attribute. This calls for a need to think about
sustainable infrastructure assessment from a cross-sectoral perspective.
