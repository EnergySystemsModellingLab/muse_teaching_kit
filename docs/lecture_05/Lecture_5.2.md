This lecture will demonstrate how we can place infrastructure assessment
in the context of sustainable development through the development of
appropriate indicators. This approach can be used by national
governments to develop a national vision for sustainable infrastructure
which incorporates a multi-dimensional, multi-sectoral approach.

# Learning objectives

-   To recognise the benefits of using metrics of infrastructure
    performance set within a sustainable development framing

-   To identify the contributions of infrastructure sectors and the
    'pillars of sustainability' to infrastructure assessment within
    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets.

# Introduction


# Summary

This lecture has demonstrated how a broader framing of infrastructure
performance, with consideration of the impact of infrastructure sectors
on sustainability dimensions, is key to placing infrastructure at the
heart of the Sustainable Development Goals. This can help
decision-makers better assess gaps in infrastructure achievement, and
quantify actions, such as investments and policies, that can be taken to
fully achieve certain SDGs and targets within a country context.
