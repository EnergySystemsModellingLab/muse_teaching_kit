    "# Running MUSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Once MUSE have been installed, we can run an example. To start with, we will run one of the built-in MUSE examples. If you are using MUSE within a virtual environment, make sure you have it activated (refer back to exercise 1 if you need help with this). \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to run the default `muse` example running the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m muse --model default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If running correctly, your prompt should output text similar to [this](https://muse-os.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/example-output.html). \n",
    "You can check the available built-in models, as well as information on other input arguments, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m muse -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use case is to take one of the built-in models as the starting point to create your own model. This is the approach we will take in the hands-on exercises in this course. To copy the files for the default model, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m muse --model default --copy path/to/copy/the/model/to\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a folder called `model` in the specified path. Navigate to this folder using the `cd` command, and use `ls` to see the contents of this folder.\n",
    "We can then run the simulation using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m muse settings.toml\n",

    "\n",
    "If the default MUSE example has run successfully, you should now have a folder called `Results` in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory should contain two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MCACapacity.csv`: contains information about the capacity each agent has per technology per benchmark year. Each benchmark year is the modelled year in the `settings.toml` file. In our example, this is 2020, 2025, ..., 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MCAPrices.csv`: has the converged price of each commodity per benchmark year and timeslice. eg. the cost of electricity at night in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional files can be added by modifying `settings.toml`, as will be shown in future exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the hands-on exercises in this course, we will use Python and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) to visualise these simulation results. You can, however, visualise the results using any language or program of your choice (for example Excel, R, MATLAB), but will get the most out of these exercises if you use Jupyter Notebook."

    "```bash\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=xxxxxxxxxx\n",
    "```\n",
    "With `xxxxxxxxxx` a very long collection of letters and numbers. Once you are on the page, you will be able to navigate to a location of your choice and create a new file, by clicking the `New` button in the top right, followed by `Python 3`. You should then be able to proceed and follow the tutorials in this documentation.\n",

    "Then you are trying to use a package (`pandas` in the example) that is not available in the current environment. It is possible to install the missing packages by running the following in the Jupyter notebook:\n",
