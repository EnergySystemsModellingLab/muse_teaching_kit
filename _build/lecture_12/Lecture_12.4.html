<h1 class="title">Mini-Lecture 12.4 - Future hazard risk - Case study</h1>
</header>
<p>In this lecture we will go through a detailed example on how to include future climate change in risk analysis. This lecture illustrates the output that can be generated using the model framework for infrastructure risk analysis introduced in previous lectures.</p>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>Learn how climate change can influence risk to assets in different ways</li>
<li>Identify infrastructure risk hotspots</li>
<li>Explain how a future climate risk assessment can inform adaptation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In this lecture, we will go through a detailed example of incorporating future climate change projections into infrastructure risk analysis. We will look at how climate scenarios were integrated in hazard modelling and how it can inform the changes in future risk, how this change in risk materialises for different assets and regions within a country. Moreover, we look at two resilience options: improving the asset engineering standards, and facilitating more efficient re-routing options in the country’s transport system.</p>
<p>The case study used here is the risk analytics performed for the transport infrastructure network of Argentina <span class="citation" data-cites="Pant2019">(Pant et al. 2019)</span>. In this study, the nation-wide road (bridges and roads), rail (bridges and rail lines), waterways and airline transport networks were considered. Using the methodology described in Lecture 9, flows, expressed in either tonnage freight or passengers, were allocated to the transport network. This represents the service provided by the individual assets (see Figures 12.4.1 and 12.4.2 below). These infrastructure services are also used to understand the network level response of asset failure; if a local road is disrupted, some/all of the freight can be re-routed to other road networks.</p>
<p>As evident in Figure 12.4.1 and 12.4.2, most of the infrastructure is concentrated in the urban areas in the east and north of the country. This is particularly evident in the rail network. For this case study, we will focus on the flood vulnerability of transport infrastructure, since flooding, both pluvial and fluvial, are considered the major hazards disrupting the transport infrastructure.</p>

<h1 id="future-hazard-scenarios">Future hazard scenarios</h1>
<p>As mentioned, in this mini-lecture we look particularly at flooding of transport infrastructure assets. For this purpose, flood hazard maps for ten return periods were adopted (ranging between 5 and 1,000-years). In this example, we will mainly focus on river flooding. The flood maps include flood extent and the inundation depth. To account for future changes in river flooding, the output of 32 Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 model ensemble was used. The 2050 time horizon was adopted in this study across two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The approach taken to simulate future flooding is a so-called scenario-neutral approach. Instead of running detailed flood simulation for all 32 GCMs at a high-resolution (and on a national level), two plausible scenarios are described that are in line with the majority of climate models. These scenarios are based on the expected change of the future 5-day maximum precipitation changes for 2050, which is a good proxy of flood occurrence, and then compared to the baseline (1986-2005). Two plausible scenarios were created, called the ‘Future Median’ scenario (+6%) and a ‘Future High’ (+12%) scenario, based on the climate model output. This was used to scale the flood extent and inundation depth. For smaller case studies, more scenarios can/should be considered to explore the uncertainty in more detail. An example of the current 1 in 1,000-year river flood map is shown in Figure 12.4.3, with the intensity of the colour indicating the inundation depth.</p>

<h1 id="future-infrastructure-exposure">Future infrastructure exposure</h1>
<p>By overlaying the current and future hazard maps with the transport network, insights can be gained on the changes in the exposure of the infrastructure assets. Critically, the change in exposure differs per return period (see Figures 12.4.4 and 12.4.5).</p>
<p>For the road network, the changes in roads exposed for the 10- and 100-year return periods equal +8.8% and +5.6% in the Future Median (FM) scenario, respectively, and up to 18.2% and 11.6% in the Future High (FH) scenario, respectively. Similar values are found for the rail network; the length of the rail lines exposed to the 10- and 100-year return periods increases by 9.2% and 8.9% in the FM scenario, respectively, and by 19.6% and 11.5% in the FH scenario, respectively. In short, the consequences of a medium extreme event (10-year) are changed more than for a very extreme event (100 year), which is critical to include in the risk analysis.</p>
<p>The change in the exposure of maritime ports and airports is more trivial. For ports, for instance, only changes in the very extreme return periods cause an increase in flooding to the port infrastructure.</p>
<p>The changes in the hazard exposure for roads and rail networks for the FH scenario (10- and 100-year return period), aggregated to the department level in Argentina, are illustrated in Figures 12.4.4 and 12.4.5.</p>
<p>For the road network (top), it can be seen that there is a relatively small (0-10%) increase in exposure which is uniform across areas, with some locations that have a decrease in exposure. For rail however, the changes are more concentrated, and some areas experience a very large increase in risk (&gt;100%). Hence, apart from looking at the aggregate numbers, understanding the spatial exposure changes is critical.</p>

<h1 id="future-economic-losses">Future economic losses</h1>
<p>Next, we consider the consequences of disruptions to the exposed transport assets. Without going into detail of disruption analysis, a step-wise procedure was followed: every asset was disrupted individually, and the potential re-routing options were considered. Re-routing resulted in increased transportation costs. If re-routing is not possible, a supply disruption to businesses is modelled, resulting in a reduction of production and economic output. The combined effect of analysis is the potential economic loss associated with the failure. The results of the impact analysis are combined with the probability of the asset being flooded for the current and future scenarios.</p>
<p>Figure 12.4.6 shows the change in expected annual economic loss (EAEL) for the rail network under the FH scenario. Now we can see on an individual asset level how the risk of service delivery changes. Some clear hotspots can be identified with the dark red colour, while there are also some sections that are expected to become less at-risk (green). A similar figure for the national road bridges is shown in Figure 12.4.7, again with clear hotspots of changing asset risk, in particular in the densely populated areas of Argentina.</p>
<p>Identification of these asset hotspots allows us to identify what assets are likely to need upgrading in the future, in particular given budget constraints. Moreover, this asset-level analysis also allows us to evaluate the benefits of resilience measures on an asset level.</p>

<h1 id="final-considerations">Final considerations</h1>
<p>We have considered the different aspects of performing a future climate risk analysis using Argentina as a case study. Some lessons learned from this are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number of future scenarios to consider depends on the spatial scale and the level of detail of the analysis. In this study, it was only realistically feasible to use two scenarios. However, for more local studies, or less detailed analysis, the whole ensemble of climate models and scenarios can be explored. We will investigate the benefits of considering a greater number of plausible scenarios in mini-lectures 14.2 and 14.3.</p></li>
<li><p>How climate change may increase the likelihood and magnitude of hazard occurrence, in this case river flooding, is very location specific, even within a country. Therefore, the change in risk may differ considerably between infrastructure networks, and between individual assets within an infrastructure network. In fact, the results showed that some assets experience an increase in risk while other experience a decrease. Moreover, we saw that for road and rail infrastructure, a similar increase in exposed assets was found across different return periods, whereas for ports, only the very high return periods changed the exposure of the assets.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of the economic losses, the changes in risk are even more asset specific. Therefore, the benefits of performing a nation-wide risk analysis, but on an asset level, to identify the most at-risk assets to future change are clearly demonstrated. This type of analysis is the backbone for evaluating the benefits of different types of interventions to improve resilience (mini-lecture 14.1).</p></li>
</ul>
