<h1 class="title">Mini-Lecture 5.4 - A target-driven development vision for a small island context</h1>
</header>
<p>This mini-lecture will demonstrate how development targets have been incorporated in the infrastructure strategy of Saint Lucia using inputs from an infrastructure planning tool. It will present results showing specific targets being met within a broader infrastructure strategy.</p>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>To learn methods for constructing and incorporating development targets in infrastructure assessment</li>
<li>To demonstrate the construction and use of a ‘Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator’ as a measure of target progress, using knowledge developed in the previous lectures.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="development-targets-and-objectives-in-national-infrastructure-planning">Development targets and objectives in national infrastructure planning</h1>
<p>Targets and objectives are an integral component of the infrastructure planning process. As described in mini-lectures 5.1 and 5.2, they allow decision-makers to determine which development criteria should be prioritised in infrastructure planning, and to what extent. This mini-lecture will highlight this aspect of the process in the Saint Lucia case study, identifying targets which have been set according to the context-specific characteristics of the small island. Examples of target selection will be shown, including those in policy documents such as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</p>
<p>Selected results of the study will demonstrate how these targets shape the overall strategy and outputs. The use of targets should be flexible and define an infrastructure vision which is subject to dynamic change, such as the emergence of new data and shifting national priorities.</p>
<h1 id="a-systematic-method-of-infrastructure-performance-target-setting-in-a-national-context">A systematic method of infrastructure performance target setting in a national context</h1>
<p>Quantified infrastructure performance targets used in the Saint Lucia assessment were established after a collaborative process of engagement with decision‐makers in the Government of Saint Lucia and drew on the development challenges facing the country (see mini-lecture 1.4).</p>
<p>A structured process was developed to identify and assign key sectoral targets and indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, a series of consultations with government entities, including over 130 stakeholders, aimed to identify desired outcomes and quantified achievement levels across strategic policy areas. For example, a feasible timeline to achieve secure (uninterrupted) water access for all regions of the island.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, a consultation of key national policy and strategy documents, such as the Third National Communication on Climate Change and the National Policy on Wastewater Management, was conducted to incorporate existing government priorities and objectives. For example, wastewater collection targets in urban areas and electricity reserve margins as entrenched in the Electricity Supply Act.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, several targets were set according to quantifiable international commitments, specifically the SDGs and Saint Lucia's NDCs under the Paris Agreement. For example, the renewable energy targets and emissions reductions indicated in Saint Lucia’s NDCs, and the SDG-based goal to halve untreated wastewater by 2030.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth, some existing targets for 2030 were extrapolated for the longer term to maintain ambitious development objectives post‐2030. For example, targeting higher wastewater treatment levels beyond the 2030 goal of ‘halving untreated wastewater.’</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth, targets based on international best practice, such as outcomes achieved in the United States or the European Union, were used as a means to set aspirational objectives for Saint Lucia. For example, rates of recycling or organic composting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These targets were entered into the infrastructure planning tool as shown in Figure 5.4.1.</p>

<h1 id="example-inputting-ndc-commitments-as-targets-in-the-planning-model">Example: Inputting NDC commitments as targets in the planning model</h1>
<p>As described in the previous section, the infrastructure planning model introduced the government's mitigation targets, as stated in the NDCs, to help define the conditions for strategic investments and policies in the energy and waste sectors. These were assigned per‐unit emissions values based on the type of fuel or technology used. For example, the embodied emissions of diesel, solar, or wind generation, or the emissions associated with various waste treatment options such as recycling, compost, or landfills. Emissions savings were then calculated according to the emissions averted through use of the infrastructure technology of a given capacity. The model used these values to ensure that a proposed strategy would not exceed the stated emissions targets.</p>
<p>Based on BAU emissions projections from 2010, these mitigation targets assume a 16% reduction in emissions by 2025 and a 23% reduction by 2030 <span class="citation" data-cites="GoSL2015">(GoSL 2015)</span> (Figure 5.4.2). In the electricity sector, energy efficiency interventions proposed in the NDCs, such as buildings and appliances, as well as demand reduction measures, were integrated into the strategy selection. While waste proposals were not quantified in the NDCs, overall reductions were achieved in this sector through a shift away from landfill towards lower emitting waste solutions. Although a high‐emitting sector, transport interventions were not included because demand in the sector relies on spatial considerations that could not be aggregated on a national scale.</p>

<h1 id="structuring-investments-and-policies-to-meet-targets-in-the-energy-sector">Structuring investments and policies to meet targets in the energy sector</h1>
<p>Figure 5.4.3 shows how the achievement of these targets is presented within the results of the long-term infrastructure planning assessment for the energy sector.</p>
<p>Favourable conditions for solar, wind, and geothermal energy on the island make these the prime supply‐side components of a National Sustainability Strategy aiming to achieve the government's renewable generation target: this is set at 35% by 2030. A subsequent scale‐up of this target to 50% is shown by 2040, with additional interventions added to achieve this.</p>
<p>Saint Lucia’s planned solar and wind installations will increase its renewables share to 14% by 2022 while maintaining strong reserve margins. This reliable capacity margin, shown as an additional target in the figure, corresponds to SDG aspirations around secure energy access for all. Saint Lucia's geothermal resources provide another untapped renewable energy source, identified as a key component of the government's renewable energy strategy. Due to technical constraints on exploiting this resource economically, the majority of its projected capacity may not come online until after 2030 but can play a major role in achieving enhanced sustainability in the sector over the long term.</p>
<p>Demand reductions and system efficiencies in the electricity network are considered relatively low‐cost interventions that could be feasibly implemented by 2030 to reduce national energy demand by over 5%, including through LED street lighting, lighting and cooling efficiencies in new buildings, and a focus on energy use reductions in the tourism sector <span class="citation" data-cites="Adshead2021">(Adshead et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="using-an-sdg-indicator-for-infrastructure-linked-targets">Using an ‘SDG indicator’ for infrastructure-linked targets</h1>
<p>Figure 5.4.4 aggregates sector-specific targets and relative achievement under the various strategies developed for the assessment (see Lecture block 6) into an ‘SDG indicator,’ as introduced in mini-lecture 5.2. Using a subset of 18 SDG targets across six goals, the figure shows how development outcomes most directly linked to electricity, water, wastewater, and solid waste infrastructure in Saint Lucia may fare under each strategy <span class="citation" data-cites="Adshead2021">(Adshead et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Current achievement across these targets is estimated at 36%, based on measured indicators assigned to each target. While a course of inaction sees this drop to 24% by 2030 as future demand growth outpaces current capacity, an infrastructure strategy based on an ambitious sustainability vision and objectives demonstrates a path to full achievement of these targets by 2030.</p>
<p>Sector‐specific impacts unique to Saint Lucia's development challenges can be identified, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SDG targets that prioritise a secure energy supply (e.g. 7.1, 7.3, and 11.1) fare relatively well in all strategies due to Saint Lucia's implementation of strong reserve margins for diesel generation</p></li>
<li><p>Targets centred on environmentally sustainable energy and waste solutions (e.g. 7.2, 9.4, 12.5, and 14.5) fare poorly and decline over time without strong interventions</p></li>
<li><p>The impact of sudden events such as the depletion of landfill capacity has immediate and visible effects across numerous targets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to ensure sustained progress toward SDG achievement, planned infrastructure interventions must also incorporate resilience to the threat of climate impacts and other external shocks <span class="citation" data-cites="Adshead2021">(Adshead et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>This mini-lecture has demonstrated the incorporation of targets in infrastructure planning. It has used a small island case study to show how relevant targets can be identified through stakeholder and document consultation, global agendas, target extrapolation, and international best practice. Infrastructure strategies and results should be explicitly shaped by these targets, which can be altered as new data or priorities emerge.</p>
