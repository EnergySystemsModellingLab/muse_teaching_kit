<h1 class="title">Mini-Lecture 5.3 - Integrating climate and development targets in infrastructure planning</h1>
</header>
<p>This lecture looks beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at how infrastructure planning can be further shaped by climate change targets through the Paris Agreement. While this draws on much of the material from Lecture block 2, it presents emerging research on the alignment of these two agendas in the run-up to the next Conference of the Parties (COP) as countries aim to set a vision for climate and development.</p>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>To describe the policy relevance of the concept of ‘climate-compatible development’</p></li>
<li><p>To relate methods by which researchers have attempted to understand interactions between climate and development targets in policy documents.</p></li>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>This lecture has introduced the importance of methods that draw on the ‘climate-compatible development’ framework. It has assessed ways in which researchers look to consolidate climate and development targets in national policy documents. Within the NDCs, current ambition as regards mitigation action in infrastructure and land use policy has been described, with a call for a framework that better integrates these two areas to bring about concrete policy actions.</p>
