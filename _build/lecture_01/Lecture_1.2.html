<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a set of universal goals for every country. The SDGs are focused on ending poverty, improving quality of life and protecting the environment. These goals were agreed on in 2015, with 2030 set as a target year for achieving them. The sustainable development goals aim to tackle multiple issues. Some of the goals are based around poverty, environmental protection, climate action, justice and more. The SDGs can be seen in Figure 1.2.1. These goals are designed to be thought of together, rather than in isolation. There are, therefore, many links between different goals.</p>

<p>In this lecture we will explore these links, global progress on the SDGs and how to factor these goals into national planning and modelling efforts.</p>
<h2 id="sustainable-development-goal-7">Sustainable Development Goal 7</h2>
<p>The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) specifically focuses on the energy sector. The first target set in SDG7 is universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. This includes electricity and access to clean cooking. Next, SDG7 calls for a substantial increase in the share of renewables in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the sustainability of energy supply. Another important element of improving the sustainability of the energy sector is energy efficiency. Therefore, SDG7 targets a doubling of the rate of global improvement in energy efficiency. Finally, SDG7 targets improved cooperation to increase access to clean energy research and technology to promote investment, as well as expanded and improved modern energy infrastructure in developing countries. All of these targets are set in pursuit of reduced poverty and greater sustainability. Whilst SDG7 focuses explicitly on the energy sector, we will see later that all of the goals are strongly interlinked as energy is important for multiple other goals.</p>

<h2 id="progress-on-sdg7-access-to-electricity-and-clean-cooking">Progress on SDG7: Access to Electricity and Clean Cooking</h2>
<p>According to the tracking SDG7 report, there has been progress in improving access to both electricity and clean cooking in recent years. This report states that electricity access increased from 83% in 2010 to 90% in 2018, whilst clean cooking increased from 56% to 63%. The report finds, however, that the current rates of progress are insufficient to meet the targets set by SDG7 by 2030. There are also key regions where progress has been substantially slower. For example, the population without access to electricity is concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa - with an overall access rate of 47%.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.2.3:</strong> Global electricity access progress <span class="citation" data-cites="UnitedNations2015">(United Nations 2015)</span></p>
<p>There are several ways in which energy modelling can be used to aid with these goals. For instance, geospatial electrification modelling can be used to assess which access solutions are the most economical for different regions or sub-regions. This also includes capacity expansion planning to assess how supply can be increased whilst minimising economic and environmental impacts.</p>
<h2 id="progress-on-sdg7-renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency">Progress on SDG7: Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency</h2>
<p>The graph below shows the share of electricity, heat and transport demands met by renewables globally. We can see that there has been some progress in increasing the share of renewables in the electricity and transport sectors as well as in the heat sector when traditional biomass use is excluded. According to the SDG7 Tracking Report, the share of renweable energy in Totla Final Energy Consumption reached 17.3 percent in 2017, up from 16.3 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>The power sector has observed the most progress. This is largely due to the growth in solar PV and wind energy. However, more progress is required to achieve SDG7, with most scenarios requiring the decarbonisation of end use sectors. For example, the electrification of transport and heat. These sectors have observed relatively slow progress.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Fig_1.2.4.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.2.4:</strong> Renewable eneergy and energy efficiency progress <span class="citation" data-cites="UnitedNations2015">(United Nations 2015)</span></p>
<p>For energy efficiency, global reductions in primary energy intensity have slowed in recent years. This is despite progress still being greater than in the period before 2010. The SDG7 Tracking Report anlysis shows that the transport sector has seen an increase in energy intensity improvement since 2010, while other sectors have seen a decrease. Differences between regions are observed, with Sub-Saharan Africa having the highest energy intensity, while Latin America and the Caribbean have the lowest.</p>
<p>If the SDG7 target of doubling the rate of global improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 is to be met, energy efficiency measures must be prioritised in policy making and investment planning.</p>
<h2 id="links-between-sdgs">Links between SDGs</h2>
<p>The SDGs are highly interlinked, with msynergies and trade-offs between these targets. It is important that these interactions are understood so that policymakers can make plans to maximise synergies and minimise trade-offs. Modelling can help in making informed decisions by better undeerstanding these interactions. This is because they can be used to develop cross-sectoral scenarios and can facilitate impacts of decisions made.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s explore the links between the energy system and the SDG targets. A study by Nerini et al [FusoNerini2018] found that at least 113 of the 169 SDG targets require changes in energy systems. Examples of this include targets in SDG13, which focuses on climate change action. This requires decarbonisation of the energy system. In addition SDG1, which focuses on ending poverty, requires improved energy infrastructure to increase modern energy access. Nerini et al. hihglight that we cannot think in silos and must use integrated planning approaches with a long-term perspective. Energy modelling tools are a key enabler of such approaches.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this mini-lecture we have explored the Sustainable Development Goals and how these apply to the energy systems and energy modelling domain. We discovered that the Sustainable Development Goals are highly interlinked, with the existence of different synergies and trade-offs between these different goals.</p>
<p>While much progress has been made, significant further progress is required to meet many of these goals. Modelling approaches can be utilised to aid with this by exploring integrated planning approaches with a long-term perspective.</p>
